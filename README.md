# Write My Calendar

## What are we doing here?

I'm making this app to solve a personal problem that hopefully applies to at least a few other people: getting their handwritten... everything into a place where they can make use of it.

For reasons I've already forgotten, I started writing a schedule by hand every morning in early 2024. It's great for organizing my thoughts and planning my day, but manually translating it into my Google Calendar so I can get reminders and have it with me thoughtout the day was a huge pain in the ass. Since multimodal LLM's are a readily accessible thing now, I decided to make WriteMyCalendar (working title).

Basically we turn this:

into this:

## How's it work?

1. Open the app.
2. Sign into your Google account (more calendars forthcoming).
3. Take a picture of your notecard (must be in the format pictured, more configurations forthcoming).
4. Wait a few seconds (usually less then 10 presently).

## What's next?

- Turning more things into more other things!
